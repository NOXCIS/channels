# Channels

Flask web-application where you can create own channels and chat with your friends/colleagues. Created with Python, TypeScript, SCSS, Bootstrap, Socket.io, Handlebars templates, and love. Bundled with Webpack.

Inspired by the Project 2 of Harvard's [CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2018/).
